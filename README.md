# Honours_project
#### This repository contains Moizle Ocariza's raw results, sequences and R scripts used in completing her BSc Honours Thesis


## Supplementary data

#### NfxB_relatives.fasta
This document contains the amino acid sequences of the proteins found homologous to _P. aeruginosa_. The amino acid sequences were from Pseudomonas Genome Database.


#### Upstream sequences

```gene_species_upstream-NfxB-related.fasta``` contains the upstream sequences of the genes encoding the NfxB homologues found.

```Pectobacterium atrosepticum``` contains this species' NfxB amino acid sequence.

```16S``` and ```23S``` sequences were both taken from IMG and used for phylogenetic tree building.
