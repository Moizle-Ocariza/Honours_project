# Honours_project
#### This repository contains Moizle Ocariza's raw results, sequences and R scripts used in completing her BSc Honours Thesis


## Supplementary data

#### NfxB_relatives.fasta
This document contains the amino acid sequences of the proteins found homologous to _P. aeruginosa_. The amino acid sequences were from Pseudomonas Genome Database.


#### Upstream sequences

```gene_species_upstream-NfxB-related.fasta``` contains the upstream sequences of the genes encoding the NfxB homologues found.

```Pectobacterium atrosepticum``` contains this species' NfxB amino acid sequence.

```16S``` and ```23S``` sequences were both taken from IMG and used for phylogenetic tree building.

```NfxB_relatives.fasta``` contains the amino acid sequences of the NfxB homologues found.

```Shuffled PAO1 intergenic region``` contains the shuffled sequences used as a control for PatScan.

```PatScan_Raw_Results``` contains the raw motifs found using the different  query patterns.

```FIMO_intergenic_scan``` contains the raw motifs found using the different query patterns.

```Motifs from homologues``` contains raw motifs found in the Pseudomonas species.

```Motifs.R``` contains the script used to process the raw motifs found using RSAT, SFM, and FIMO. Files required are stored in the ```Rscript files``` folder.

```FIMO intergenic scan``` contains the inverted repeats identified by FIMO in the PAO1 intergenic regions. These are the raw results.
